                         I am David Griffiths, a country boy as most would put it, I hail from St. Thomas
                         and I’ve come to the University of the West Indies to pursue my degree in Computer Science.
                          I went through the various levels of schooling in Jamaica, but it was not until I started secondary 
                          school at the Morant Bay High that writing became noticeable in my life. Like a wall flower starting 
                          to bloom, the intricacies of the English language were brought to my attention and I began to delve 
                          deeper into the language and developed a liking for it. While my peers complained about English being
                           hard and boring, I always enjoyed learning about it. I had very good relationships with all my English
                            teachers throughout high school and this made me excel. I wonder if I liked studying English because
                             of my teachers or liked my teachers because I liked studying English. In any case, I’ve had great 
                             experiences with writing thus far as I’ve always enjoyed it and I always excel in it.

                      <p>After viewing
                        the video “ABC Nightline - IDEO Shopping Cart”, what I particularly appreciate about it is how the
                        design group focuses their energy on solving the problem and building on each other’s ideas rather
                        than being distracted by things off topic, or overly criticizing a point which benefits no one.
                        They also mentioned that within an innovative group, there is no hierarchy. This is especially
                        noteworthy because innovation thrives when each member is viewed as an equal. Going forward, 
                        I will be especially keen to keep these valuable points in mind and I will be applying them 
                        while interacting with my team when working on group assignments for Critical Reading and Writing
                        in Science and Technology and Medical Sciences.

                        Everyday we learn new things, but how often do we apply what we learn to how we live our lives? 
                        What is the point of knowledge if it is not used to better our lives? Critical reading and writing             
                        for Science & Technology and Medical Sciences (CRIT) is a course that is meant to improve the reading 
                        and writing of the students of the UWI. While doing CRIT I was placed into a team of four people, two
                        of the opposite sex and one from another country. My team was no doubt diverse. As we worked toward the 
                        goal of improving our reading and writing, I learned two valuable lessons, 1) CRIT is more valuable than 
                        I had initially thought and 2) being able to adapt effectively to difficult situations is will help me
                         excel in the work world.</p>
                        <p>
                        Critical reading and writing for Science & Technology and Medical Sciences is not just some random course 
                        that needs to be done to be eligible for graduation. It is quite valuable and provides practical skills which
                        will benefit me in both the near and distant future. CRIT has opened my eyes to the necessity of maintaining 
                        academic integrity and providing the correct credit to those whose work I use to augment and support my own. 
                        I was taught the correct way to summarize and paraphrase, to make my voice heard as I interpreted and analyzed
                        data. I was thought how to effectively narrow my focus to save time when researching. Having a set goal in mind
                        is a lot better than trying to make do with just an idea. As an aspiring computer scientist, being able to 
                        narrow my focus will help me to find the most efficient way to solve whatever problem I am faced with, saving 
                        valuable time. I plan to use these aspects of CRIT to be a better more efficient computer scientist.
